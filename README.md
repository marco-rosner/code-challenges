## Code Challenges and preparation to interviews

This repository is a collection of resources and code challenges (mostly from HackerHank and Medium articles) in Javascript and ReactJS that I solved and created in my journey to return to the tech industry after my sabbatical. I started doing this privately then I realized that it could help other people to prepare themselves for their journey too so I decided to give publicity to all this content.

Feel free to use, learn, comment, criticize, or do whatever you want with all the content here.
