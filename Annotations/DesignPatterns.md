> Creation Patterns

- Factory Method - The class gives the intantiation responsability for sub-classes
- Singleton - Assure that a class have an unique instance and a global way to access it.

> Structural Patterns

- Adapter - Convert a class interface in another interface which the clients are used to deal with.  
- Facade - Unified interface with a set of interfaces in a subsystem

> Behavioral Patterns
 
- DAO (Data Access Object)-> Abstraction of data persistence. Close to the database, often table-centric.  
- Repository -> Abstraction of a collection of objects. Close to the Domain layer.  
- DTO (Data Transfer Object) -> Transport data between layers of the application.
